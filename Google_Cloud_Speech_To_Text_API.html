<h1>Speech-to-Text API in Collaboration with Google Cloud</h1>
<p>A Speech-to-Text API synchronous recognition request is the simplest method for performing recognition on speech audio data. Speech-to-Text can process <strong>up to 1 minute</strong> of speech audio (and size <strong>up to 10MB</strong>) data sent in a synchronous request (can be uploaded from the storage of my own computer). After Speech-to-Text processes and recognizes all of the audio, it returns a response.</p>
<p>I am going to convert to text a recorded session (from TedTalks) between an interviewer and co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates. The length for this conversion is <strong>longer</strong> than 1 minute and the size is <strong>greater</strong> than 10MB. For that reason I no longer can upload a short recording from my computer, but instead use the local storage at google cloud service and provide the designated key (or location) of that recorded session for the purpose of speech-to-text conversion.</p>
<p>A link for the recorded interview can be found <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_innovations_we_need_to_avoid_a_climate_disaster/transcript?language=en">here</a></p>

<pre><code>Transcript: it said that&#39;s a lie I merely asked you on Today Show the philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in conversation with Ted Global curator changes for the world to avoid climate disaster he talks or something called the green premium lays out Innovations we need to invest in and shares why younger Generations are the key to getting to net zero emissions and also have his love for burgers is changing the conversation is from March 2021 and part of countdown Ted Global initiative to xcelerate solutions to The Climate Crisis get involved at countdown head.com
Transcript: Bill Gates cousin self an imperfect Messenger on climate because of his high carbon footprint and the lifestyle however he is just made a major contribution to our thinking about confronting climate change a book A book about decarbonizing our economy and Society it&#39;s an optimistic can do kind of book with a strong focus on technological solutions he discusses the things we have such as wind and solar power the things we need to develop such as carbon free cement work a freestyle and long-term energy storage and he talks about the economics of it all introducing the concept of a green onion and simplifying here alone use that fighting climate change is going to be hard but it&#39;s possible we can do it during the pathway to a clean and prosperous future for all
Transcript: who is the author of the book when I come back to town thank you like to start where you start from the title of the book how to avoid the climate disaster which of course I presume that you&#39;re heading toward the time of disaster if we don&#39;t act differently so what is the single most important thing we must do to avoid the coming disaster the greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere particularly Co to stay there for thousands of years and so it&#39;s really the sum of all those submissions are forcing the temperature higher and higher which will have disastrous effects and so we have to take these emissions which are presently over 51 billion tonnes per year and ride those all the way down to zero and that&#39;s when the temperature will stop and creasing and the disastrous weather events won&#39;t get worse and worse
Transcript: you know it&#39;s pretty demanding it&#39;s not a 50% reduction it&#39;s all the way down to zero visualize the scale of a pocket scale of the problem and all the different sources and people are mostly where the production of electricity with natural gas and coal is being a big Source that&#39;s about 27% and there&#39;s someone where of Transportation including Passenger cars Passenger cars are 7% and transportation overall is 16% of the other three segments in which is 19 per cent Heating and Cooling buildings including using that for gas or 7% and then sadly the biggest Sacramento Mall
Transcript: manufacturing including steel and cement people are least aware of that one and in fact that one is the most difficult for us to solve the size of the of the steel plant cement plants that paper plastic the industrial economy is gigantic and we&#39;re asking that have to be changed in this earlier. When we don&#39;t even know how to make that change right now so I&#39;m simplifying things we grow things we got around to me and so we need to get to a point where green energy that&#39;s cheap as 40 fuse and new material stream of the cheapest car materials and you call that eliminating the green premium so to start tell us what you mean by Green premium
Transcript: yeah so the green premium berries from emission sources hits the cost to buy that product where there&#39;s been no emissions versus all the cost we have today and so for an electric car the ring premium is reasonably modest you pay a little more upfront you save a bit on the maintenance and gasoline are you give up some range you have a longer charging time to go to the next 15 years because the volume is there and they are and he&#39;s being done we can expect that the electric car will be preferable it won&#39;t cost more will have a much higher range and so that green premium that today is about 15% is headed to be zero even without any government subsidies and so that&#39;s magic that&#39;s exactly what we need to do for every other category now
Transcript: X-Men where we haven&#39;t really gotten started yet the green premium today is almost double the price that is you pay $125 for a today but it would be almost double that if you insisted that it be green cement and so the way I think of this is in 2050 will be talkin to Indian same to them please use the green products is your building basic shelter you know simple air conditioning which they&#39;ll need because of the heat increaser in a lighting at night for students and unless we&#39;re willing to subsidize it for the price is very low belsano this is a problem that the rich countries created that India suffering from and you need to take care of it so only by bringing that green premium down very dramatically about
Transcript: 25% across all categories will that conversation go well so that India can make that shift until the key thing here is that the US has responsibility is not just 20 out it&#39;s a mission that&#39;s very hard thing but we&#39;re only 15% unless we threw our power of innovation make it so cheap for all countries to switch all categories then we simply aren&#39;t going to get there and so the US really has to step up and use all of this Innovative capacity every year for the next 30 Years to happen in order for these breakthroughs to actually kind of who are the players who need to come together and usually happens at a pace of its own here we have this deadline 2015
Transcript: and we have to do everything we can to accelerate it we need to raise the R&amp;D budgets in these areas in 2015 I organized along with President Obama assign to the Paris climate talks where what Prime Minister Modi is labeled Mission and it was a commitment to double R&amp;D budgets over a five-year period in all the the big countries came in and and made that pledge then we need lots of smart people who instead of working out of their problems are encouraged to work on these problems so coming up with funding for them is very very important I&#39;m doing some of that through what I call break to energy fellows we need high risk Capital to invest in these companies even though the risks are very very high and that&#39;s
Transcript: where is now breakthrough energy Ventures as one group doing that and drawing lots of other people in but then the most difficult thing is we actually need markets for these products even it when they start out being more expensive and that&#39;s what I call Catalyst organizing the buying power of consumers and companies and governments so that we get on the learning curves get the scale going up like we did with solar wind across all these categories so it&#39;s both Supply and Innovation and demand for the the green products if that&#39;s the
Transcript: combination that can start us to make this change to the physical in the infrastructure of the entire physical economy the financial system as a whole right now is essentially funding expansion of fossil fuels consistent with him at 3 degrees Celsius in cuisine in a state or the finest me to Beyond venture-capital about needs to think and act differently
Transcript: well if you look at the interest rates for a solar field versus any other types of Investments it&#39;s not lower in a money is is very fungible it&#39;s going to be a different projects but you know there&#39;s no sort of special rate for climate-related projects now in a government&#39;s tax incentive to improve those things but it&#39;s not this is not just about reporting numbers it&#39;s good to report numbers but the steel industry is providing a vital service even gasoline from 98 per cent of the cars being purchased today allows people to get to their job and so you know just I best mental owns not going to be the thing that creates the new alternative and brings that the cost of that down so the finance side will be important because the speed of deployment
Transcript: solar wind needs to be accelerated dramatically beyond anything we&#39;ve done today in fact you know an average will have to deploy three times as much every year as the peak year so far in a into those are the those are a key part of the solution they&#39;re not the whole whole solution but the people sometimes think just by putting numbers in a disclosing numbers that somehow it all changes are by divesting that all changes the financial sector is important but without the Innovation there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing they can do is going towards cutting emissions by half by 2030 and on the way to Richie Net Zero by 2050
Transcript: the only real measure of how well we&#39;re doing is the green premium because that&#39;s what determines whether India and other developing countries will choose to use the Cerro Mission approach in 2050 at the idea that you know you if you&#39;re focusing on short-term reductions then you can say oh that&#39;s fantastic we just put billions of dollars into natural gas plants and even or ignoring that there&#39;s a lot of leaky pipes that doesn&#39;t get properly measured in a give them full credit and say that&#39;s a 50% reduction the the lifetime of that plant is greater than 30 years assuming you&#39;re getting value out of it over a longer period of time so to say hey Hallelujah we switch from coal to natural gas that has nothing to do with reaching zero it set you back because of the capital spending involve there and so it&#39;s not a path to zero if you&#39;re just working
Transcript: easy parts of the emission that&#39;s not a path the path is to take every source of admission and say oh my goodness how am I going to get that green for me I&#39;m down how many can I get back bring premium doubt you know otherwise and I&#39;m getting the 50% does not stop the problems at this is very top because of the nature has zero it&#39;s not just a small small decrease
Transcript:  stop getting the green pin him down so you mention India at 2 to make sure that the transition transition is also an Indian store in an African story not only should which country has adopted the expected pensive teen am now to buy down the green pinot and make technology there for more accessible to low-income countries absolutely have to pick which product pads with scale will become Lo Green premium products and see you don&#39;t want to just randomly pick things that are low emission you have to pick things that will come down so like you know so far hydrogen fuel cells have knocked on that now they might in the future solar wind and lithium-ion we&#39;ve seen these Incredible cost reduction since we have to
Transcript:  duplicate that for other areas things like offshore wind he pumped new ways of doing transmission in a we have to keep the electricity grid even in very bad weather conditions so that&#39;s where storage or nuclear and transmission will have to be scaled up in a very significant way in which we now have this open source mall to look at that and so the Divine of green products that demand signal I would I call Catalyst we&#39;re going to have to orchestrate a lot of money many tens of billions of dollars for that that was one of the most expensive pieces so that the improvements in these other areas and some of them we haven&#39;t even gotten started on what he did mostly a question of consuming Less in particular consuming less
Transcript:  energy and in the book you actually write several times that we need to consume more energy by living conditions that we take for granted should be made available to all humans and the human population is growing and so you&#39;re going as you provide shelter heating and air conditioning which anywhere near the equator will be more in demand since you have many days where you can&#39;t go Outdoors at all so we&#39;re not going to stop making shelter we&#39;re not going to stop making food and so we need to be able to multiply those processes by zero that is you make shelter but there&#39;s no emissions emissions that&#39;s how you get all the way down 2-0 now it&#39;s me it&#39;s so much easier if rich countries are consuming less
Transcript:  but you know how far will that go to your book if we eliminate the transition somehow can cost enter the key driver significant citizen involvement not enough on on those other valuables we need all these things if you don&#39;t have a d engagement particular by the younger generation making this a top priority every year for the next 30 years across all the developed countries we will not succeed and I&#39;m not the one who knows how to activate all those people I&#39;m super glad that the people are smart about that or are thinking it&#39;s a necessary element likewise the
Transcript:  he said I do have experience and Innovation systems that&#39;s a necessary element you will not get there just by saying please stop using steel it it it won&#39;t happen and and so the Innovation piece has two to come along and particularly encouraging consumers to buy electric cars or artificial meat or electric heat pumps they&#39;re part of driving that demand when I call the catalytic demand that long do it because some of these big projects like green hydrogen or green aviation fuel require billions and capital expense but the demand signal from Enlighten consumers is very important their political voice is very important they&#39;re pushing the companies they work at is very important and so I absolutely agree
Transcript:  broadcast who cares about this particular understand how hard it is and don&#39;t say you know we can do it in 10 years they are super important and I know you love burgers and you tried an official burger and how do you find it yet I&#39;m an investor in all these impossible Beyond various people and I have to say the progress in that sector is greater than I expected five years ago I would have said that is as hard as manufacturing now it&#39;s very hard but not as hard as manufacturing there is no you know impossible Foods Green steel and the quality is going to keep improving it&#39;s it&#39;s quite good today you know there&#39;s other companies coming into that space covering different types of food and as the volume goes up the price
Transcript:  go down and so yeah I think it&#39;s quite promising I have to admit I don&#39;t hundred percent of my Burgers aren&#39;t artificially at it&#39;s about 50% but I&#39;ll get there it&#39;s a star you already on 20 30 on that on the front so you mention yours proceeding you know how to say Exquisite modesty in the book where you say you think like an engineer as well they are mostly responding to voters interest most of the countries were talking about our our democracies and the
Transcript:  there are resources that will need to be put in like tax credits that includes buying green products or in a government purchasing up green products at slightly higher prices you know those are real trade-offs and you know making sure that the areas where there&#39;s lots of jobs in say coal mining or in a things for the demand will go down having that political sensitivity and thinking through can we put the new jobs in that area and what are the Departments handle that this is is a tough political problem and you know my admonition of people is not only to get educated themselves but help educate other people and often you know like in the US if it&#39;s people are both parties that&#39;s even better be
Transcript:  the level of interest is high but it needs to get even higher almost like a moral mission of all young people to go beyond their individual success that they they believed that getting to serial by 2050 is is critical thank you now before we continue the interview I would like to take a short DeTour for 1 minute because my colleagues that had a death produced a series of seven animated videos inspired by your book they introduced the concept of NetZero discuss other questions and challenges, I would like to share one shorty from one of those animations
Transcript:  you flip a switch coal Burns in a furnace which turns water into steam that steam spins a turbine which activates a generator which pushes electrons Through the Wire this current propagates through hundreds of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home
Transcript:  all around the world countless people are doing this every second flipping a switch plugging in pressing an on button so how much electricity does Humanity need
Transcript:  the answer to dads and too many other climate questions of course he&#39;s in the seven animations available on the site and data that YouTube channel did you mentioned before how does the younger Generations role in solving this problem inspire you
Transcript:  well they
Transcript:  make sure this is a priority and if we have you know it&#39;s a priority for 4 years and it&#39;s not for 4 years you can&#39;t ask investment in the new approach to take place he&#39;s got to be pretty clear that even though in a political parties May disagree on the tactics of the same way they agree there should be a strong defense that they agree this 0 by 2050 is a shared goal and then you know just got the okay how do you were discovered command word it&#39;s a private sector come in which area of the service priority and that will be a huge milestone where it&#39;s a a discussion about how to get there first asked whether to get there in the U.S has the most fraught and terms of it being in a politicized even in terms of used to say a huge problem
Transcript:  you know young people they&#39;re going to be around to see the good news is if we were able to achieve this you know I won&#39;t and I&#39;ll be around but you know they they speak with moral Authority and they have in a particular people are stepping up on this but you know I hope that&#39;s just the beginning and I&#39;m not quite this year I think is so important all this recovery money being program people thinking about the government&#39;s protect us the way they should I do government work together in a dependent because T this up it&#39;s okay what&#39;s the next big problem we need to collaborate around and I and I&#39;m hoping that climate appears because of these activist
Transcript:  maybe going to come back to her the pandemic question better want to talk about some specific technology breakthroughs that you mentioned in the book but you also just mentioned that the Breakthrough energy best thing to clean tech startup and advocate for what he&#39;s going to do in several Technologies including children died of carbon capture Edition by if you want to ask you about specific investment but I would like to ask you to discuss why do spirits may be starting with green hydrogen if we can get green hydrogen that&#39;s very cheap and we don&#39;t know that we can
Transcript:  that becomes a Magic ingredients to a lot of processes that let you make fertilizer without using natural gas it let you reduce iron or steel production without using any form of coal and so there&#39;s two ways to make you can take water and split into hydrogen and oxygen intake natural gas and pull out the hydrogen and so it&#39;s kind of a holy grail and until we need to get going we need to get the all the components to be very very cheap and only by actually doing projects significant scale projects do you get on to that learning curve and so Catalyst will fund you know the early pilot projects along with governments to go
Transcript:  and I&#39;ll go make green hydrogen get the electrolyzers to get up in volume and get a lot cheaper because that would that would be a huge Advance a lot of manufacturing not all of it but a lot of it would be solved with that so just for those was done no green hydrogen he&#39;s produced clean energy source is Wayne store and buy theirs and produced from natural gas to propane gas is called gray hydrogen burning carbon from the atmosphere and the least in theory we can find a way to do that at large-scale together before then or just the problem could be solved but it&#39;s a very early stage unproven technology you describe yourself in the book as a thought experiment at this stage but you&#39;re one of the main investors in the sector in the world so what&#39;s the real potential for Direct
Transcript:  yes sir there is a company today climb works that for a bit over $600 a ton will do capture now it&#39;s a fairly small scale customer of theirs has part of my program where I live and all my carbon emissions in a Gold Standard whey other other people are trying to do larger-scale plants like carbon Engineering in a breakthrough energies investing in a number of these carbon capture entities in a way that carbon capture is for the part that you can&#39;t solve any other way it&#39;s kind of the Brute Force peace and no one knows what that price will be in if it&#39;s $100 a tonne then you know the cost against current emissions would be 5 trillion a year can we get below $100 a tonne it&#39;s not not clear that we can
Transcript:  but it would be fantastic to take the final ten 15% of the missions and instead of making the change at the place where the admission takes place just do this structure capture to be clear that you&#39;re just filter in the air and you&#39;re pulling out the 410 million parts per million and putting that into a pressurized form of CO2 that then you sequester in some place that you know it&#39;ll stay for millions of years and so it&#39;s this industry is just at the very very beginning but it&#39;s a necessary piece for the tale of of emissions third priority is efficient if he was flying over the last several years to become a symbol of polluting lifestyle
Transcript:  the great thing about Pastor cars is that in a batteries don&#39;t store
Transcript:  energy as well as gasoline does a romantic difference the you can afford to have the exercise and weight of those batteries on a plane that is a large plane going a long distance there&#39;s no chance that batteries will ever have that energy density I mean there&#39;s some crazy people who are working out and I&#39;ll be glad to find that but you wouldn&#39;t want to count on that and so you either have to use hydrogen as a plane pill that has 4 challenges or you just want to make today&#39;s aviation fuel with green prophecies like using plants as the source of how you make those and so I&#39;m the biggest individual customer group that makes green aviation fuel so that&#39;s what I&#39;m using now cost
Transcript:  as the normal aviation fuel but as the demand scales up you know that&#39;s one of those green premiums that we hope to bring down so that you know some point lots of consumers will say yes I&#39;ll pay a little extra on my plane ticket probably through Catalyst or through the airline to make sure that that we&#39;re building up that industry and trying to get the the cost the great that cream premium down quite a bit so this is a super important area that you know I was amazed when I went to buy that you know I was by far the biggest individual customer it&#39;s all sorts of course I&#39;m very symbolic have your eyes people think of cars and think of airplanes when they think of a solution and and and and the mission
Transcript:  it&#39;s your case for neuter be appreciated is the energy has to come from somewhere and so is you stop using that for gas to heat homes and gasoline to power cars the electric grid will have to grow dramatically and even in the case of the US where electricity demand has been plowed the last two decades will mean to be almost three times as large as you do that with weather-dependent sources the reliability of the electricity generation goes away that is you get big cold front step for 10 days can stop most of the wind and solar saying in the in the midwest so the question is
Transcript:  how do you use massive amounts of transmission and storage and non weather dependent sources which its scale nucleares is the only choice there to maintain that reliability and not have people say freeze to death and nuclear people be pretty impressed with how valuable it is to create that reliability now 80% at least in the US will be wind and solar so we have to build that faster than ever but you know what is that piece that&#39;s always available is is where nuclear would fit in
Transcript:  are you talk a lot about scaling up the college in the book I want to ask you a question about scaling down cuz one thing that&#39;s absent from your book is a discussion about scaling down for the fuel production may be starting with at least not expanding it anymore with adopting a sort of fossil-fuel non-proliferation approach because right now we&#39;re building our future infrastructure what what&#39;s your view on that demand for fossil fuels and the fact that the green premium is very high if you want to restrict Supply
Transcript:  Daniel Gil Drive the price up you know people still want to drive to their job if you know say you made fossil fuels illegal you know try that for a few weeks I might be with you have to create a substitute because the services provided by the fossil-fuel are actually quite valuable electricity is value transportation is valuable and are you willing to drop demand for those things 20 and Saudi the capitalistic economy will respond if it&#39;s clear you know how you&#39;re going to do your tax policies in your credit you&#39;re going to drive Innovation then the infrastructure investments in those things will go down we see that with cold already today but it it just speaking against something when you have a create an altar
Transcript:  isn&#39;t going to get you 20 and read the letter M on dates with the climate challenge actually apply to Planet to avoid disastrous future outcomes in individual citizens aren&#39;t equipped to either do those evaluations or you know think through the. Orandi and deployment plan that&#39;s necessary here and so we have to make it imperative that governments hopefully if any
Transcript:  party going into this the pandemic we did eventually get Global cooperation the US didn&#39;t play it&#39;s normal role there but the private sector Innovation created the vaccine now sadly would claim that the pain is causing gets worse over time so it would depend Emich we had all these deaths and people were like wow okay we should do something with climate you can&#39;t wait you know the coral reefs will have died off the species will be gone and so if you say okay will let you know when it gets bad will invent something like a vaccine that doesn&#39;t work because to stop the emissions you have to change every steel plant cement plant you know car things that have massive lead times and literally trillions of dollars of investment and so you know what the pandemic we messed up we didn&#39;t pay attention
Transcript:  people like myself said it was her problem but you know now we&#39;re getting our way out of it to Innovation climates harder much are the problem so the political will to get it right needs to be unprecedented compared to the pandemic girl almost any other political cause I want to correct you on the point about Planet X renovation because of course a lot of public money went into funding research and and I got it purchases and so forth that I&#39;ve seen but that&#39;s a separate interview with no government money Big Challenge is over half of the total of greenhouse gas emissions since 1750 or 51 it&#39;s got up in the atmosphere in the last 30 years I&#39;ve known for more than 30 years that they have an opening
Transcript:  to say the least and policies in collaborations in a we&#39;ve wasted a lot of time that we should have used to work on the hard parts of climates just having short-term goals and not focusing on the R&amp;B peace in the last 20 years we don&#39;t have much to show for the card categories now you know there&#39;s still time to get there we will have to find out a piece of a great deal because the 2015 is not because that&#39;s a goal that gives you 0 damage it&#39;s simply the school that is the most ambitious that has a chance of being achieved
Transcript:  and we are causing problems for subsistence farmers and sea-level rise and wildfires and natural ecosystems and so the adaptation side is even more underfunded in the mitigation side for example you know helping poor Farmers with seeds that can deal with the the droughts and high temperatures is funded it less than a billion a year which is is deeply tragic
Transcript:  when you&#39;re heading towards the end I mentioned the beginning of the book you describe yourself as an imperfect Messenger on climate what changes made in your personal and family life would use your footprint driving an electric car in putting solar panels on the houses and where that makes sense in using this green aviation fuel you know I still can&#39;t say that you know I&#39;ve stopped eating meat or that I never fly and so it&#39;s mostly by funding over 7 million a year the products that although their green premiums are very high today like the carbon capture like the aviation fuel if he knows you actually going to get those on to the learning curve to get those prices down very dramatic
Transcript:  what area did I do is hide fund putting in electric heat pumps in the low-cost housing and so instead of using that they get a lower bill because it&#39;s the city and I paid that extra Capital cost as as an offset so you know accelerating those demands things you know I tried to get out in front of that you also talking to book about the pay more than market value or the current market price for upsets and you hinted to him before talking about the golden standard tell us about what kind of process can be kind of confusing and controversial what kind of sets
Transcript:  well first of all it&#39;s great that we&#39;re finally talking about offsets and any company that actually looks at their emissions and pays for offsets is way better than a company that either doesn&#39;t look at their missions or looks at them and doesn&#39;t pay for offsets and so the leading companies are now buying offsets some of them spending hundreds of millions to buy offsets that is a very very good thing the ability to see which offsets actually have long-term benefit that really keep the carbon out for the over thousands of years to count their now organizations that I and others are funny to label offsets this either gold standard
Transcript:  different levels of the impact and you&#39;re the price of offsets Range from $15 a tonne to $600 a tonne some of the low-cost ones may be really lived in a like reducing natural gas leakage is is pretty dramatic in some cases in terms of the dollars per tons of waited there a lot of the forest three things will probably not end up looking that good as you really look at the lifetime of the tree or what would have happened otherwise. Do you know at least we&#39;re talking about offsets now and now we&#39;re going to do it in a thoughtful way to the interview may already be very well this time you be looking for ways to to step up and at the end of the book Giver chapter about individual action give us maybe
Transcript:  I say two examples two practical examples of things that individual citizens in the US but also as we&#39;re can do to play a meaningful role in tackling climate change
Transcript:  everybody should start by learning more you know you know how much steel do we make can where are the soap steel plants and although sadly it&#39;s a source of so many missions once you really educate yourself then you&#39;re in a position to educate others hopefully of diverse political beliefs about why this is so important and yet you know it&#39;s also very very hard to do you have all your buying Behavior electric cars out of his shell mean you know and you&#39;ll see for all the different products berries things that indicate how green that product is and your demand doesn&#39;t just save those emissions it also encourages the Improvement of of the green product in a political voice I&#39;d still put it in a one
Transcript:  in a making sure your company is measuring its its emissions and is starting to fund offsets on his willing to be a customer for you no breakthrough Storage Solutions or in the green aviation fuel that is catalytic and love those funds hopefully we&#39;ll go through this vehicle that&#39;s really identify which projects globally are technologies that that won&#39;t stay expensive fiction do like what solar and wind it in and come down and in price so individuals are what drive this thing me and the democracies are where are most Innovation power is and they have to get activated and then set the example
Transcript:  I would like to to end on the outcome maybe we should have started with the outcome but let&#39;s imagine a world where we will actually have done all of what you described in the book and everything else that&#39;s necessary what would the future everyday life look like
Transcript:  I think everybody will be really proud that Humanity came together on a global basis to make this radical change and there&#39;s no precedent for it in the human world war is for we orchestrated lots of resources and I was like a 45-year duration and here were talking about three decades of hard work dealing with an enemy that super bad stuff is out in the future and so you&#39;re benefiting young people and in future Generations in some ways you know I am a life will look a lot like it does today you&#39;ll still have buildings you&#39;ll have air conditioning you have lights at night but all of those your * 0 in terms of what the emissions that come out of those activities are you know during the same time frame will have a dance
Transcript:  send Medicine of curing cancer and finishing polio and malaria and all sorts of things and so by taking away this one&#39;s super negative thing then all the progress we make another areas in a won&#39;t get reduced by this awful thing that if it&#39;s goes unchecked the migration out of the equatorial regions in the number of decimate the pandemic look like nothing you know I think so from a moral point of view and letting the other improvements not be offset by this
Transcript:  it&#39;ll be
Transcript:  a a source of great pride that hey we came together that&#39;s something we actually do a big thank you for sharing your knowledge thank you for this very very important for the book and thank you for coming back to today

<pre><code>[&quot;it said that&#39;s a lie I merely asked you on Today Show the philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in conversation with Ted Global curator changes for the world to avoid climate disaster he talks or something called the green premium lays out Innovations we need to invest in and shares why younger Generations are the key to getting to net zero emissions and also have his love for burgers is changing the conversation is from March 2021 and part of countdown Ted Global initiative to xcelerate solutions to The Climate Crisis get involved at countdown head.com&quot;,
 &quot;Bill Gates cousin self an imperfect Messenger on climate because of his high carbon footprint and the lifestyle however he is just made a major contribution to our thinking about confronting climate change a book A book about decarbonizing our economy and Society it&#39;s an optimistic can do kind of book with a strong focus on technological solutions he discusses the things we have such as wind and solar power the things we need to develop such as carbon free cement work a freestyle and long-term energy storage and he talks about the economics of it all introducing the concept of a green onion and simplifying here alone use that fighting climate change is going to be hard but it&#39;s possible we can do it during the pathway to a clean and prosperous future for all&quot;,
 &quot;who is the author of the book when I come back to town thank you like to start where you start from the title of the book how to avoid the climate disaster which of course I presume that you&#39;re heading toward the time of disaster if we don&#39;t act differently so what is the single most important thing we must do to avoid the coming disaster the greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere particularly Co to stay there for thousands of years and so it&#39;s really the sum of all those submissions are forcing the temperature higher and higher which will have disastrous effects and so we have to take these emissions which are presently over 51 billion tonnes per year and ride those all the way down to zero and that&#39;s when the temperature will stop and creasing and the disastrous weather events won&#39;t get worse and worse&quot;,
 &quot;you know it&#39;s pretty demanding it&#39;s not a 50% reduction it&#39;s all the way down to zero visualize the scale of a pocket scale of the problem and all the different sources and people are mostly where the production of electricity with natural gas and coal is being a big Source that&#39;s about 27% and there&#39;s someone where of Transportation including Passenger cars Passenger cars are 7% and transportation overall is 16% of the other three segments in which is 19 per cent Heating and Cooling buildings including using that for gas or 7% and then sadly the biggest Sacramento Mall&quot;,
 &quot;manufacturing including steel and cement people are least aware of that one and in fact that one is the most difficult for us to solve the size of the of the steel plant cement plants that paper plastic the industrial economy is gigantic and we&#39;re asking that have to be changed in this earlier. When we don&#39;t even know how to make that change right now so I&#39;m simplifying things we grow things we got around to me and so we need to get to a point where green energy that&#39;s cheap as 40 fuse and new material stream of the cheapest car materials and you call that eliminating the green premium so to start tell us what you mean by Green premium&quot;,
 &quot;yeah so the green premium berries from emission sources hits the cost to buy that product where there&#39;s been no emissions versus all the cost we have today and so for an electric car the ring premium is reasonably modest you pay a little more upfront you save a bit on the maintenance and gasoline are you give up some range you have a longer charging time to go to the next 15 years because the volume is there and they are and he&#39;s being done we can expect that the electric car will be preferable it won&#39;t cost more will have a much higher range and so that green premium that today is about 15% is headed to be zero even without any government subsidies and so that&#39;s magic that&#39;s exactly what we need to do for every other category now&quot;,
 &quot;X-Men where we haven&#39;t really gotten started yet the green premium today is almost double the price that is you pay $125 for a today but it would be almost double that if you insisted that it be green cement and so the way I think of this is in 2050 will be talkin to Indian same to them please use the green products is your building basic shelter you know simple air conditioning which they&#39;ll need because of the heat increaser in a lighting at night for students and unless we&#39;re willing to subsidize it for the price is very low belsano this is a problem that the rich countries created that India suffering from and you need to take care of it so only by bringing that green premium down very dramatically about&quot;,
 &quot;25% across all categories will that conversation go well so that India can make that shift until the key thing here is that the US has responsibility is not just 20 out it&#39;s a mission that&#39;s very hard thing but we&#39;re only 15% unless we threw our power of innovation make it so cheap for all countries to switch all categories then we simply aren&#39;t going to get there and so the US really has to step up and use all of this Innovative capacity every year for the next 30 Years to happen in order for these breakthroughs to actually kind of who are the players who need to come together and usually happens at a pace of its own here we have this deadline 2015&quot;,
 &quot;and we have to do everything we can to accelerate it we need to raise the R&amp;D budgets in these areas in 2015 I organized along with President Obama assign to the Paris climate talks where what Prime Minister Modi is labeled Mission and it was a commitment to double R&amp;D budgets over a five-year period in all the the big countries came in and and made that pledge then we need lots of smart people who instead of working out of their problems are encouraged to work on these problems so coming up with funding for them is very very important I&#39;m doing some of that through what I call break to energy fellows we need high risk Capital to invest in these companies even though the risks are very very high and that&#39;s&quot;,
 &quot;where is now breakthrough energy Ventures as one group doing that and drawing lots of other people in but then the most difficult thing is we actually need markets for these products even it when they start out being more expensive and that&#39;s what I call Catalyst organizing the buying power of consumers and companies and governments so that we get on the learning curves get the scale going up like we did with solar wind across all these categories so it&#39;s both Supply and Innovation and demand for the the green products if that&#39;s the&quot;,
 &#39;combination that can start us to make this change to the physical in the infrastructure of the entire physical economy the financial system as a whole right now is essentially funding expansion of fossil fuels consistent with him at 3 degrees Celsius in cuisine in a state or the finest me to Beyond venture-capital about needs to think and act differently&#39;,
 &quot;well if you look at the interest rates for a solar field versus any other types of Investments it&#39;s not lower in a money is is very fungible it&#39;s going to be a different projects but you know there&#39;s no sort of special rate for climate-related projects now in a government&#39;s tax incentive to improve those things but it&#39;s not this is not just about reporting numbers it&#39;s good to report numbers but the steel industry is providing a vital service even gasoline from 98 per cent of the cars being purchased today allows people to get to their job and so you know just I best mental owns not going to be the thing that creates the new alternative and brings that the cost of that down so the finance side will be important because the speed of deployment&quot;,
 &quot;solar wind needs to be accelerated dramatically beyond anything we&#39;ve done today in fact you know an average will have to deploy three times as much every year as the peak year so far in a into those are the those are a key part of the solution they&#39;re not the whole whole solution but the people sometimes think just by putting numbers in a disclosing numbers that somehow it all changes are by divesting that all changes the financial sector is important but without the Innovation there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing they can do is going towards cutting emissions by half by 2030 and on the way to Richie Net Zero by 2050&quot;,
 &quot;the only real measure of how well we&#39;re doing is the green premium because that&#39;s what determines whether India and other developing countries will choose to use the Cerro Mission approach in 2050 at the idea that you know you if you&#39;re focusing on short-term reductions then you can say oh that&#39;s fantastic we just put billions of dollars into natural gas plants and even or ignoring that there&#39;s a lot of leaky pipes that doesn&#39;t get properly measured in a give them full credit and say that&#39;s a 50% reduction the the lifetime of that plant is greater than 30 years assuming you&#39;re getting value out of it over a longer period of time so to say hey Hallelujah we switch from coal to natural gas that has nothing to do with reaching zero it set you back because of the capital spending involve there and so it&#39;s not a path to zero if you&#39;re just working&quot;,
 &quot;easy parts of the emission that&#39;s not a path the path is to take every source of admission and say oh my goodness how am I going to get that green for me I&#39;m down how many can I get back bring premium doubt you know otherwise and I&#39;m getting the 50% does not stop the problems at this is very top because of the nature has zero it&#39;s not just a small small decrease&quot;,
 &quot; stop getting the green pin him down so you mention India at 2 to make sure that the transition transition is also an Indian store in an African story not only should which country has adopted the expected pensive teen am now to buy down the green pinot and make technology there for more accessible to low-income countries absolutely have to pick which product pads with scale will become Lo Green premium products and see you don&#39;t want to just randomly pick things that are low emission you have to pick things that will come down so like you know so far hydrogen fuel cells have knocked on that now they might in the future solar wind and lithium-ion we&#39;ve seen these Incredible cost reduction since we have to&quot;,
 &quot; duplicate that for other areas things like offshore wind he pumped new ways of doing transmission in a we have to keep the electricity grid even in very bad weather conditions so that&#39;s where storage or nuclear and transmission will have to be scaled up in a very significant way in which we now have this open source mall to look at that and so the Divine of green products that demand signal I would I call Catalyst we&#39;re going to have to orchestrate a lot of money many tens of billions of dollars for that that was one of the most expensive pieces so that the improvements in these other areas and some of them we haven&#39;t even gotten started on what he did mostly a question of consuming Less in particular consuming less&quot;,
 &quot; energy and in the book you actually write several times that we need to consume more energy by living conditions that we take for granted should be made available to all humans and the human population is growing and so you&#39;re going as you provide shelter heating and air conditioning which anywhere near the equator will be more in demand since you have many days where you can&#39;t go Outdoors at all so we&#39;re not going to stop making shelter we&#39;re not going to stop making food and so we need to be able to multiply those processes by zero that is you make shelter but there&#39;s no emissions emissions that&#39;s how you get all the way down 2-0 now it&#39;s me it&#39;s so much easier if rich countries are consuming less&quot;,
 &quot; but you know how far will that go to your book if we eliminate the transition somehow can cost enter the key driver significant citizen involvement not enough on on those other valuables we need all these things if you don&#39;t have a d engagement particular by the younger generation making this a top priority every year for the next 30 years across all the developed countries we will not succeed and I&#39;m not the one who knows how to activate all those people I&#39;m super glad that the people are smart about that or are thinking it&#39;s a necessary element likewise the&quot;,
 &quot; he said I do have experience and Innovation systems that&#39;s a necessary element you will not get there just by saying please stop using steel it it it won&#39;t happen and and so the Innovation piece has two to come along and particularly encouraging consumers to buy electric cars or artificial meat or electric heat pumps they&#39;re part of driving that demand when I call the catalytic demand that long do it because some of these big projects like green hydrogen or green aviation fuel require billions and capital expense but the demand signal from Enlighten consumers is very important their political voice is very important they&#39;re pushing the companies they work at is very important and so I absolutely agree&quot;,
 &quot; broadcast who cares about this particular understand how hard it is and don&#39;t say you know we can do it in 10 years they are super important and I know you love burgers and you tried an official burger and how do you find it yet I&#39;m an investor in all these impossible Beyond various people and I have to say the progress in that sector is greater than I expected five years ago I would have said that is as hard as manufacturing now it&#39;s very hard but not as hard as manufacturing there is no you know impossible Foods Green steel and the quality is going to keep improving it&#39;s it&#39;s quite good today you know there&#39;s other companies coming into that space covering different types of food and as the volume goes up the price&quot;,
 &quot; go down and so yeah I think it&#39;s quite promising I have to admit I don&#39;t hundred percent of my Burgers aren&#39;t artificially at it&#39;s about 50% but I&#39;ll get there it&#39;s a star you already on 20 30 on that on the front so you mention yours proceeding you know how to say Exquisite modesty in the book where you say you think like an engineer as well they are mostly responding to voters interest most of the countries were talking about our our democracies and the&quot;,
 &quot; there are resources that will need to be put in like tax credits that includes buying green products or in a government purchasing up green products at slightly higher prices you know those are real trade-offs and you know making sure that the areas where there&#39;s lots of jobs in say coal mining or in a things for the demand will go down having that political sensitivity and thinking through can we put the new jobs in that area and what are the Departments handle that this is is a tough political problem and you know my admonition of people is not only to get educated themselves but help educate other people and often you know like in the US if it&#39;s people are both parties that&#39;s even better be&quot;,
 &#39; the level of interest is high but it needs to get even higher almost like a moral mission of all young people to go beyond their individual success that they they believed that getting to serial by 2050 is is critical thank you now before we continue the interview I would like to take a short DeTour for 1 minute because my colleagues that had a death produced a series of seven animated videos inspired by your book they introduced the concept of NetZero discuss other questions and challenges, I would like to share one shorty from one of those animations&#39;,
 &#39; you flip a switch coal Burns in a furnace which turns water into steam that steam spins a turbine which activates a generator which pushes electrons Through the Wire this current propagates through hundreds of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home&#39;,
 &#39; all around the world countless people are doing this every second flipping a switch plugging in pressing an on button so how much electricity does Humanity need&#39;,
 &quot; the answer to dads and too many other climate questions of course he&#39;s in the seven animations available on the site and data that YouTube channel did you mentioned before how does the younger Generations role in solving this problem inspire you&quot;,
 &#39; well they&#39;,
 &quot; make sure this is a priority and if we have you know it&#39;s a priority for 4 years and it&#39;s not for 4 years you can&#39;t ask investment in the new approach to take place he&#39;s got to be pretty clear that even though in a political parties May disagree on the tactics of the same way they agree there should be a strong defense that they agree this 0 by 2050 is a shared goal and then you know just got the okay how do you were discovered command word it&#39;s a private sector come in which area of the service priority and that will be a huge milestone where it&#39;s a a discussion about how to get there first asked whether to get there in the U.S has the most fraught and terms of it being in a politicized even in terms of used to say a huge problem&quot;,
 &quot; you know young people they&#39;re going to be around to see the good news is if we were able to achieve this you know I won&#39;t and I&#39;ll be around but you know they they speak with moral Authority and they have in a particular people are stepping up on this but you know I hope that&#39;s just the beginning and I&#39;m not quite this year I think is so important all this recovery money being program people thinking about the government&#39;s protect us the way they should I do government work together in a dependent because T this up it&#39;s okay what&#39;s the next big problem we need to collaborate around and I and I&#39;m hoping that climate appears because of these activist&quot;,
 &quot; maybe going to come back to her the pandemic question better want to talk about some specific technology breakthroughs that you mentioned in the book but you also just mentioned that the Breakthrough energy best thing to clean tech startup and advocate for what he&#39;s going to do in several Technologies including children died of carbon capture Edition by if you want to ask you about specific investment but I would like to ask you to discuss why do spirits may be starting with green hydrogen if we can get green hydrogen that&#39;s very cheap and we don&#39;t know that we can&quot;,
 &quot; that becomes a Magic ingredients to a lot of processes that let you make fertilizer without using natural gas it let you reduce iron or steel production without using any form of coal and so there&#39;s two ways to make you can take water and split into hydrogen and oxygen intake natural gas and pull out the hydrogen and so it&#39;s kind of a holy grail and until we need to get going we need to get the all the components to be very very cheap and only by actually doing projects significant scale projects do you get on to that learning curve and so Catalyst will fund you know the early pilot projects along with governments to go&quot;,
 &quot; and I&#39;ll go make green hydrogen get the electrolyzers to get up in volume and get a lot cheaper because that would that would be a huge Advance a lot of manufacturing not all of it but a lot of it would be solved with that so just for those was done no green hydrogen he&#39;s produced clean energy source is Wayne store and buy theirs and produced from natural gas to propane gas is called gray hydrogen burning carbon from the atmosphere and the least in theory we can find a way to do that at large-scale together before then or just the problem could be solved but it&#39;s a very early stage unproven technology you describe yourself in the book as a thought experiment at this stage but you&#39;re one of the main investors in the sector in the world so what&#39;s the real potential for Direct&quot;,
 &quot; yes sir there is a company today climb works that for a bit over $600 a ton will do capture now it&#39;s a fairly small scale customer of theirs has part of my program where I live and all my carbon emissions in a Gold Standard whey other other people are trying to do larger-scale plants like carbon Engineering in a breakthrough energies investing in a number of these carbon capture entities in a way that carbon capture is for the part that you can&#39;t solve any other way it&#39;s kind of the Brute Force peace and no one knows what that price will be in if it&#39;s $100 a tonne then you know the cost against current emissions would be 5 trillion a year can we get below $100 a tonne it&#39;s not not clear that we can&quot;,
 &quot; but it would be fantastic to take the final ten 15% of the missions and instead of making the change at the place where the admission takes place just do this structure capture to be clear that you&#39;re just filter in the air and you&#39;re pulling out the 410 million parts per million and putting that into a pressurized form of CO2 that then you sequester in some place that you know it&#39;ll stay for millions of years and so it&#39;s this industry is just at the very very beginning but it&#39;s a necessary piece for the tale of of emissions third priority is efficient if he was flying over the last several years to become a symbol of polluting lifestyle&quot;,
 &quot; the great thing about Pastor cars is that in a batteries don&#39;t store&quot;,
 &quot; energy as well as gasoline does a romantic difference the you can afford to have the exercise and weight of those batteries on a plane that is a large plane going a long distance there&#39;s no chance that batteries will ever have that energy density I mean there&#39;s some crazy people who are working out and I&#39;ll be glad to find that but you wouldn&#39;t want to count on that and so you either have to use hydrogen as a plane pill that has 4 challenges or you just want to make today&#39;s aviation fuel with green prophecies like using plants as the source of how you make those and so I&#39;m the biggest individual customer group that makes green aviation fuel so that&#39;s what I&#39;m using now cost&quot;,
 &quot; as the normal aviation fuel but as the demand scales up you know that&#39;s one of those green premiums that we hope to bring down so that you know some point lots of consumers will say yes I&#39;ll pay a little extra on my plane ticket probably through Catalyst or through the airline to make sure that that we&#39;re building up that industry and trying to get the the cost the great that cream premium down quite a bit so this is a super important area that you know I was amazed when I went to buy that you know I was by far the biggest individual customer it&#39;s all sorts of course I&#39;m very symbolic have your eyes people think of cars and think of airplanes when they think of a solution and and and and the mission&quot;,
 &quot; it&#39;s your case for neuter be appreciated is the energy has to come from somewhere and so is you stop using that for gas to heat homes and gasoline to power cars the electric grid will have to grow dramatically and even in the case of the US where electricity demand has been plowed the last two decades will mean to be almost three times as large as you do that with weather-dependent sources the reliability of the electricity generation goes away that is you get big cold front step for 10 days can stop most of the wind and solar saying in the in the midwest so the question is&quot;,
 &quot; how do you use massive amounts of transmission and storage and non weather dependent sources which its scale nucleares is the only choice there to maintain that reliability and not have people say freeze to death and nuclear people be pretty impressed with how valuable it is to create that reliability now 80% at least in the US will be wind and solar so we have to build that faster than ever but you know what is that piece that&#39;s always available is is where nuclear would fit in&quot;,
 &quot; are you talk a lot about scaling up the college in the book I want to ask you a question about scaling down cuz one thing that&#39;s absent from your book is a discussion about scaling down for the fuel production may be starting with at least not expanding it anymore with adopting a sort of fossil-fuel non-proliferation approach because right now we&#39;re building our future infrastructure what what&#39;s your view on that demand for fossil fuels and the fact that the green premium is very high if you want to restrict Supply&quot;,
 &quot; Daniel Gil Drive the price up you know people still want to drive to their job if you know say you made fossil fuels illegal you know try that for a few weeks I might be with you have to create a substitute because the services provided by the fossil-fuel are actually quite valuable electricity is value transportation is valuable and are you willing to drop demand for those things 20 and Saudi the capitalistic economy will respond if it&#39;s clear you know how you&#39;re going to do your tax policies in your credit you&#39;re going to drive Innovation then the infrastructure investments in those things will go down we see that with cold already today but it it just speaking against something when you have a create an altar&quot;,
 &quot; isn&#39;t going to get you 20 and read the letter M on dates with the climate challenge actually apply to Planet to avoid disastrous future outcomes in individual citizens aren&#39;t equipped to either do those evaluations or you know think through the. Orandi and deployment plan that&#39;s necessary here and so we have to make it imperative that governments hopefully if any&quot;,
 &quot; party going into this the pandemic we did eventually get Global cooperation the US didn&#39;t play it&#39;s normal role there but the private sector Innovation created the vaccine now sadly would claim that the pain is causing gets worse over time so it would depend Emich we had all these deaths and people were like wow okay we should do something with climate you can&#39;t wait you know the coral reefs will have died off the species will be gone and so if you say okay will let you know when it gets bad will invent something like a vaccine that doesn&#39;t work because to stop the emissions you have to change every steel plant cement plant you know car things that have massive lead times and literally trillions of dollars of investment and so you know what the pandemic we messed up we didn&#39;t pay attention&quot;,
 &quot; people like myself said it was her problem but you know now we&#39;re getting our way out of it to Innovation climates harder much are the problem so the political will to get it right needs to be unprecedented compared to the pandemic girl almost any other political cause I want to correct you on the point about Planet X renovation because of course a lot of public money went into funding research and and I got it purchases and so forth that I&#39;ve seen but that&#39;s a separate interview with no government money Big Challenge is over half of the total of greenhouse gas emissions since 1750 or 51 it&#39;s got up in the atmosphere in the last 30 years I&#39;ve known for more than 30 years that they have an opening&quot;,
 &quot; to say the least and policies in collaborations in a we&#39;ve wasted a lot of time that we should have used to work on the hard parts of climates just having short-term goals and not focusing on the R&amp;B peace in the last 20 years we don&#39;t have much to show for the card categories now you know there&#39;s still time to get there we will have to find out a piece of a great deal because the 2015 is not because that&#39;s a goal that gives you 0 damage it&#39;s simply the school that is the most ambitious that has a chance of being achieved&quot;,
 &#39; and we are causing problems for subsistence farmers and sea-level rise and wildfires and natural ecosystems and so the adaptation side is even more underfunded in the mitigation side for example you know helping poor Farmers with seeds that can deal with the the droughts and high temperatures is funded it less than a billion a year which is is deeply tragic&#39;,
 &quot; when you&#39;re heading towards the end I mentioned the beginning of the book you describe yourself as an imperfect Messenger on climate what changes made in your personal and family life would use your footprint driving an electric car in putting solar panels on the houses and where that makes sense in using this green aviation fuel you know I still can&#39;t say that you know I&#39;ve stopped eating meat or that I never fly and so it&#39;s mostly by funding over 7 million a year the products that although their green premiums are very high today like the carbon capture like the aviation fuel if he knows you actually going to get those on to the learning curve to get those prices down very dramatic&quot;,
 &quot; what area did I do is hide fund putting in electric heat pumps in the low-cost housing and so instead of using that they get a lower bill because it&#39;s the city and I paid that extra Capital cost as as an offset so you know accelerating those demands things you know I tried to get out in front of that you also talking to book about the pay more than market value or the current market price for upsets and you hinted to him before talking about the golden standard tell us about what kind of process can be kind of confusing and controversial what kind of sets&quot;,
 &quot; well first of all it&#39;s great that we&#39;re finally talking about offsets and any company that actually looks at their emissions and pays for offsets is way better than a company that either doesn&#39;t look at their missions or looks at them and doesn&#39;t pay for offsets and so the leading companies are now buying offsets some of them spending hundreds of millions to buy offsets that is a very very good thing the ability to see which offsets actually have long-term benefit that really keep the carbon out for the over thousands of years to count their now organizations that I and others are funny to label offsets this either gold standard&quot;,
 &quot; different levels of the impact and you&#39;re the price of offsets Range from $15 a tonne to $600 a tonne some of the low-cost ones may be really lived in a like reducing natural gas leakage is is pretty dramatic in some cases in terms of the dollars per tons of waited there a lot of the forest three things will probably not end up looking that good as you really look at the lifetime of the tree or what would have happened otherwise. Do you know at least we&#39;re talking about offsets now and now we&#39;re going to do it in a thoughtful way to the interview may already be very well this time you be looking for ways to to step up and at the end of the book Giver chapter about individual action give us maybe&quot;,
 &quot; I say two examples two practical examples of things that individual citizens in the US but also as we&#39;re can do to play a meaningful role in tackling climate change&quot;,
 &quot; everybody should start by learning more you know you know how much steel do we make can where are the soap steel plants and although sadly it&#39;s a source of so many missions once you really educate yourself then you&#39;re in a position to educate others hopefully of diverse political beliefs about why this is so important and yet you know it&#39;s also very very hard to do you have all your buying Behavior electric cars out of his shell mean you know and you&#39;ll see for all the different products berries things that indicate how green that product is and your demand doesn&#39;t just save those emissions it also encourages the Improvement of of the green product in a political voice I&#39;d still put it in a one&quot;,
 &quot; in a making sure your company is measuring its its emissions and is starting to fund offsets on his willing to be a customer for you no breakthrough Storage Solutions or in the green aviation fuel that is catalytic and love those funds hopefully we&#39;ll go through this vehicle that&#39;s really identify which projects globally are technologies that that won&#39;t stay expensive fiction do like what solar and wind it in and come down and in price so individuals are what drive this thing me and the democracies are where are most Innovation power is and they have to get activated and then set the example&quot;,
 &quot; I would like to to end on the outcome maybe we should have started with the outcome but let&#39;s imagine a world where we will actually have done all of what you described in the book and everything else that&#39;s necessary what would the future everyday life look like&quot;,
 &quot; I think everybody will be really proud that Humanity came together on a global basis to make this radical change and there&#39;s no precedent for it in the human world war is for we orchestrated lots of resources and I was like a 45-year duration and here were talking about three decades of hard work dealing with an enemy that super bad stuff is out in the future and so you&#39;re benefiting young people and in future Generations in some ways you know I am a life will look a lot like it does today you&#39;ll still have buildings you&#39;ll have air conditioning you have lights at night but all of those your * 0 in terms of what the emissions that come out of those activities are you know during the same time frame will have a dance&quot;,
 &quot; send Medicine of curing cancer and finishing polio and malaria and all sorts of things and so by taking away this one&#39;s super negative thing then all the progress we make another areas in a won&#39;t get reduced by this awful thing that if it&#39;s goes unchecked the migration out of the equatorial regions in the number of decimate the pandemic look like nothing you know I think so from a moral point of view and letting the other improvements not be offset by this&quot;,
 &quot; it&#39;ll be&quot;,
 &quot; a a source of great pride that hey we came together that&#39;s something we actually do a big thank you for sharing your knowledge thank you for this very very important for the book and thank you for coming back to today&quot;]</code></pre>
