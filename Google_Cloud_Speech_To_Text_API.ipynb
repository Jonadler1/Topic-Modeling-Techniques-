            "Transcript: you know it's pretty demanding it's not a 50% reduction it's all the way down to zero visualize the scale of a pocket scale of the problem and all the different sources and people are mostly where the production of electricity with natural gas and coal is being a big Source that's about 27% and there's someone where of Transportation including Passenger cars Passenger cars are 7% and transportation overall is 16% of the other three segments in which is 19 per cent Heating and Cooling buildings including using that for gas or 7% and then sadly the biggest Sacramento Mall\n",

When we don't even know how to make that change right now so I'm simplifying things we grow things we got around to me and so we need to get to a point where green energy that's cheap as 40 fuse and new material stream of the cheapest car materials and you call that eliminating the green premium so to start tell us what you mean by Green premium\n",
            "Transcript: yeah so the green premium berries from emission sources hits the cost to buy that product where there's been no emissions versus all the cost we have today and so for an electric car the ring premium is reasonably modest you pay a little more upfront you save a bit on the maintenance and gasoline are you give up some range you have a longer charging time to go to the next 15 years because the volume is there and they are and he's being done we can expect that the electric car will be preferable it won't cost more will have a much higher range and so that green premium that today is about 15% is headed to be zero even without any government subsidies and so that's magic that's exactly what we need to do for every other category now\n",
            "Transcript: X-Men where we haven't really gotten started yet the green premium today is almost double the price that is you pay $125 for a today but it would be almost double that if you insisted that it be green cement and so the way I think of this is in 2050 will be talkin to Indian same to them please use the green products is your building basic shelter you know simple air conditioning which they'll need because of the heat increaser in a lighting at night for students and unless we're willing to subsidize it for the price is very low belsano this is a problem that the rich countries created that India suffering from and you need to take care of it so only by bringing that green premium down very dramatically about\n",
            "Transcript: 25% across all categories will that conversation go well so that India can make that shift until the key thing here is that the US has responsibility is not just 20 out it's a mission that's very hard thing but we're only 15% unless we threw our power of innovation make it so cheap for all countries to switch all categories then we simply aren't going to get there and so the US really has to step up and use all of this Innovative capacity every year for the next 30 Years to happen in order for these breakthroughs to actually kind of who are the players who need to come together and usually happens at a pace of its own here we have this deadline 2015\n",
